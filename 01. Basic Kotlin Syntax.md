Kotlin, just like languages like C, C++ and Java, has the `main` function. All the code goes inside the main function. Well, you might create your own function and use it in the main function. A function in Kotlin is declared using the following syntax -
``` kotlin
fun <function_name>() {
	/// Your code goes here
}
```
So if we try to declare the `main` function, it will look like this - 
``` kotlin
fun main() {
	/// Your code goes here
}
```

## Print Statement
We can print any statement in the console via the `println()` function. So, to print **Hello World** in the console, we need to run - 
``` kotlin
fun main() {
	println("Hello World")
}
```
To print any statement we **MUST** use the quotation marks ("...")

## Declaring variables
Alike other languages, we can declare variables in Kotlin to reuse them in the code. Kotlin uses two keywords to declare them: `var` and `val`. The difference between them is - you can change the value of `var` later in the code, but you can't change the value of `val`, it will throw an error.

To declare the type of the variable we can use the syntax `var <variable_name>: <variable_type> = value`. So, to declare an integer with the value 10 and a string with the text **"Bangladesh"**, we can write -
``` kotlin
fun main() {
	var country: String = "Bangladesh"
	var number: Int = 10
}
```
Although, Kotlin can recognize the data type automatically. So can you use the following and it also will be a totally valid code - 
``` kotlin
fun main() {
	var country = "Bangladesh"
	var number = 10
}
```

#### Difference between `var` and `val`
As previously stated, we can alter the value of `var`, but we can't change `val`. For example -
``` Kotlin
fun main() {
	var country = "Bangladesh"
	println(country)
	country = "India" // You don't need to put `var` again...
	println(country)
}
```
Running the above code will give a valid output in the console without an error - 
```
Bangladesh
India

Process finished with exit code 0
```
But using the above code using `val`, instead of `var` will give an error - 
<div style="color: red">
<pre>
Kotlin: Val cannot be reassigned
</pre>
</div>

#### You CAN'T change the Data Type
``` Kotlin
fun main() {
	var myVar = "Bangladesh"
	myVar = 1971
}
```
The above code will produce the following error, as we are trying to reassign the variable `myVar` with an integer, while it is a string.
<div style="color: red">
<pre>
Kotlin: The integer literal does not conform to the expected type String
</pre>
</div>

## Printing a variable
You can print a variable in the console using the syntax `println(variable_name)` or if you are trying to print that in a line, you can use a dollar sign `$` in front of the variable name.
``` Kotlin
fun main() {
	var country = "Bangladesh"
	var name = "Fahmid"
	println(name)
	println("You live in $country!")
}
```
